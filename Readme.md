# Cory Engine
> Vulkan toy renderer

## Goals
This project is inteded to be a toy rendering engine to familiarize myself with vulkan.
I also use it to test more modern C++ features.

#### Short Term
- Modern C++ (17/20)

#### Mid Term
- C++ Modules (if possible)
- Render Graphs/Frame Graphs
- Implement a simple Volume Raymarcher
- Find a legitimate use for C++ coroutines?

#### Long Term
- Implement Monte Carlo Volume Raycasting
- Play around with ray tracing


## Cory?
According to [this very trustworthy-looking web source](http://www.talesbeyondbelief.com/roman-gods/vulcan.htm), *Corynetes* was the son of the roman god Vulkan.

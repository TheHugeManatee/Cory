# Cory Engine
> Vulkan toy renderer/playground

## Goals
This project is inteded to be a toy rendering engine to familiarize myself with vulkan.
I also use it to test more modern C++ features.

#### Short Term
 - Huge refactoring of the sample code
 - establish basic structures for a reusable rendering lib
 - 
#### Mid Term
- Modern C++ (17/20)
- C++ Modules (if possible)
- Render Graphs/Frame Graphs
- Implement a simple Volume Raymarcher
- Find a legitimate use for C++ coroutines?
- Type Reflection

#### Long Term
- Implement Monte Carlo Volume Raycasting
- Play around with ray tracing
